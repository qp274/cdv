Surveillance capitalism treats private human experiences as free sources of raw material, feed these raw materials to AI and production chains, to transform into its ultimate products: services and predictions of our behavior. The prediction products in fact influence our behavior towards some preferred direction. This entire chain reaction of profit is based on companies turning everything they can observe about “users” into data that they can exploit. Ultimately surveillance capitalism exacerbates the asymmetry of knowledge and undermines our own human autonomy and decision rights. Zuboff states one of the danger is that surveillance capitalism is bleeding out of the economic domain into the social domain. It is now taking control and eroding democracy.

This reminds of the blatant practice of one of the biggest Chinese social media platform Weibo. Weibo collects data of clicks and searches about certain keywords and generates topics on its trending page. Among the ranked “trends”, we can often see juxtapositions of celebrity gossips ranking higher than political movements. Celebrity publicity groups would pay weibo to have a place in the trending page. Under the trending tag there would also be statistics of “how many people chose this emoji to express their emotion towards this topic”. However the platform would manipulate the data and show only partial results of whether the “trends” or the reaction emojis. The trends are also rhetorically worded to influence public’s opinion. At this point there is no way of knowing how much weibo distorted the proportion of data to achieve control over public opinion. There is a saying that “if the product is free, then you are the product”. It rings especially true in this context.

The danger of surveillance capitalism is doubled. Not only are institutions bypassing our awareness to extract ‘resources’ from us, they are profiting off of us, diverging our interests, feeding us the products that were made out of *us*.

One may argue that facing with, for example, the little check box of “I agree”, we do have some degree of awareness and agency during the process. And I think Zuboff is trying to point out how surveillance capitalism dramatizes this power/knowledge inequality. The “I agree” from the downstream of a power hierarchy is certainly questionable. The very move that surveillance capitalism erodes democracy lies in misleading, deceiving, diverging people’s attention.
