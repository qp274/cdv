could probably scrape data from nick cave's song lyrics from this lyrics website and make something like this [Tarantino profanities and violence Visualization](https://www.behance.net/gallery/102011893/Tarantino-Data-Visualization). I could possibly have wordcount/frequency oount for violence, profanities, Jesus references and see the trend throughout his career. I'm a hardcore nick cave fan so I'm pretty sure there are much more profanity and violence in his first band *the birthday party* and significantly more peace and biblical references in his more recent works with Warren Ellis.

data UFO sightings around the world classified by date/year, country, shape of the UFO, duration, and latititude. I am especially interested in the shapes of the UFOs. Could create time series chart, shape charts(group the dots into the shapes), and country(map?).
